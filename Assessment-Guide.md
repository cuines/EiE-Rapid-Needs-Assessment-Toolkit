# Education in Emergencies (EiE) Rapid Needs Assessment Guide

## Introduction
This guide outlines a rapid assessment methodology for education programming in crisis‑affected contexts. The goal is to collect essential information within a short timeframe (typically 1–2 weeks) to inform immediate response planning and resource allocation.

## 1.0 Key Stakeholders to Interview
Engaging the right stakeholders ensures a comprehensive understanding of the education landscape and builds local ownership. Prioritize the following groups:

* **Government Education Authorities** – District/provincial education officers, school inspectors
* **School Management Committees** – Principals, teachers, parent representatives
* **Community Leaders** – Traditional leaders, religious leaders, youth representatives
* **Humanitarian Actors** – Education cluster/sector coordinators, NGO field staff
* **Learners** – Children and youth (using age‑appropriate methods)
* **Parents/Caregivers** – Especially female‑headed households
* **Local Civil Society Organizations** – Women’s groups, disability organizations, youth networks
* **Other Sector Specialists** – Protection, WASH, health, shelter (for cross‑sectoral linkages)

## 2.0 Essential Data Points to Collect
Focus on quantitative and qualitative data that directly informs programming decisions.

### 2.1 Access and Enrollment
* Total number of school‑aged children (3–17 years) in the affected area
* Number of out‑of‑school children (disaggregated by sex, age, disability status)
* Pre‑crisis enrollment figures (if available)
* Barriers to enrollment (safety, distance, cost, cultural norms)

### 2.2 Learning Spaces and Infrastructure
* Number of functional schools/learning spaces
* Condition of existing infrastructure (damage assessment)
* Availability of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities
* Safe access routes to learning spaces

### 2.3 Teaching Capacity
* Number of available teachers (disaggregated by sex, qualification)
* Teacher absenteeism and turnover rates
* Immediate training needs (psychosocial support, inclusive pedagogy, etc.)
* Availability of teaching and learning materials

### 2.4 Curriculum and Certification
* Status of the formal curriculum (suspended, adapted, etc.)
* Alternative education programs (accelerated learning, catch‑up classes)
* Certification and examination pathways for displaced learners

### 2.5 Protection and Well‑being
* Reported incidents of violence, harassment, or exploitation in or around schools
* Availability of referral mechanisms for child protection cases
* Psychosocial support services for learners and teachers
* School‑based health and nutrition services

## 3.0 Security and Ethical Considerations
Conducting assessments in volatile environments requires strict adherence to safety and ethical standards.

### 3.1 Do No Harm
* Ensure assessment activities do not exacerbate existing tensions or create new risks.
* Obtain informed consent from all participants, explaining the purpose and use of the data.
* Protect the anonymity and confidentiality of sensitive information.

### 3.2 Security Protocols
* Coordinate with local authorities and security‑focal points before field visits.
* Use safe and agreed‑upon communication channels.
* Establish clear evacuation and contingency plans for assessment teams.

### 3.3 Inclusive Participation
* Actively seek the perspectives of marginalized groups (girls, children with disabilities, ethnic minorities).
* Use accessible communication methods (local language, sign language, pictograms).
* Ensure assessment teams are gender‑balanced and culturally sensitive.
